# Battleship_Project

Proposal:
Our team members are Russell Deady, John Ronzo, Andrew Franklin, Randy Toyberman, and Tyler Flaherty. The title of our project is Dynamic Fighting Ships. We hope to program a battleship-styled game where you can move your ships in-between every turn. We plan on utilizing the pygame library to do this. We plan to  have two people focus on the GUI, two people focusing on the mechanics of the game, and one person focusing on the networking.

Project Design:
There are several Battleship games written in Python with some using Pygame. We will extended the current state of the art for those that use Pygame by introducing a rule change that allows players to move their ships during the game. We will also implement a multiplayer feature with socket programming that allows LAN play. 
Libraries: Pygame, Socket, Random

Multiplayer: Randy
GUI: Russell, 
Mechanics: John
