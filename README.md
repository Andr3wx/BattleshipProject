# CIS4930_Project

Our team members are Russell Deady, John Ronzo, Andrew Franklin, Randy Toyberman, and Tyler Flaherty. The title of our project is Dynamic Fighting Ships. We hope to program a battleship-styled game where you can move your ships in-between every turn. We plan on utilizing the pygame library to do this. We plan to  have two people focus on the GUI, two people focusing on the mechanics of the game, and one person focusing on the networking.
